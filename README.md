### Philosophy 🤔

The main goals for this playlist are listed below:

**Quality over quantity** ✨
- All channels should work well.
- Channels should be in HD as much as possible, not SD.
- Only one URL per channel (no +1, no alternate feeds, no regional declinations)

**Only free channels** 🆓
- No paid channels
- Only channels which are officially provided for free

**Only mainstream channels** 🌈
- No adult channels
- No channels dedicated to any particular religion, political party, or funded by a different country

### Feed sources 📡

Finding up-to-date URLs can be tricky; here's a list of sources:

- https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/tree/master/streams
- YouTube: As long as the channel is live and its URL doesn't change
- Dailymotion: Same criteria as for YouTube
